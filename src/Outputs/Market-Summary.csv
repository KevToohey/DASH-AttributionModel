31/01/2024,Outlook M,Lower Inflation Here We Come !
31/01/2024,Outlook M,"After two years of increasing and higher interest rates, inflation seems to be waning. As we have experienced, high inflation is bad for investment markets because it means, higher interest rates, higher economic ambiguity, and for shares, a reduced quality of earnings.  All of which means that shares tend to trade on lower price to earnings multiples (PEs) when inflation is high.  Conversely, when rates are falling, borrowing costs reduce, spending increases, and future company profits become less valuable especially on new or growing companies where most profits are still years away, and P/E multiples increase, as witnessed with some of the technology companies.  "
31/01/2024,Outlook M,"For conservative investors looking for income in 2024, rate cuts, as opposed to rate hikes, call for a different approach to investing. Here are some investments to think about when rates inevitably begin to come down: Term deposits, Long dated government bonds, Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs & G-REITs), Preference shares, High dividend paying companies (fully franked)"
